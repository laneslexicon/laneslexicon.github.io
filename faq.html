         <h4>Q and A</h4>
	      <ul>
                <li>Will it be free? <br/>Yes. It will be doubly-free: the sources will be released
                  (free is in freedom) and it won't cost anything (free as in beer).
                </li>
                <li>What will it run on? <br/>I'll be releasing installers for Windows and OSX together
                  with build instructions for other platforms.
                </li>
                <li>When will it be ready?<br/>In a couple of months, I hope. (Mind, I also said that
                  a couple of months ago.)
                </li>
                <li>What do I need to build a version for my OS?<br/>
                  You'll need a copy of the <a href="qt-project.org">Qt framework</a>, an XSLT library
                  and Perl (to build the database). The software is being developed under Debian Linux
                  using free, opensource licensed tools.
              </ul>
      </section>
       <section>
         <h4>Features</h4>
         <ul>
           <li>You can search for a root, a head word, or do a full-text search for an Arabic word (with or without diacritics)
             or an English word. If you know regular expression syntax, you can even search that way.
             </li>
           <li>The text from the Lexicon can be copied and pasted into whatever you like.</li>
           <li>Entries can be printed.</li>
           <li>It can be customized - for example,if you don't like the Arabic font it ships with, you can
             use any font you want.</li>
           <li>It comes with a virtual Arabic keyboard to help you enter Arabic text. If you know the Buckwalter
             transliteration, you can also enter Arabic that way.</li>
           <li>It has simple note taking facility that allows you to attach your own comments to Lexicon entries.</li>
           <li>Bookmarks, history, the usual stuff..</li>
