        <p>Resolving cross references</p>
        <p>To quote from Lane's Preface:</p>
          <em>In order to facilitate the reference, an arrow-head (â†“) is inserted to render conspicuous a word explained in a paragraph headed by another word.) Several obvious advantages result from this arrangement; not the least of which is a considerable saving of room.</em>
          <br/>
          <p>The <a href="#sources">text</a> contains 36031 cross-references. In the application, Lane's arrow-head becomes a clickable link.
            At the moment, 26253  of those cross-references are resolved, leaving 9778 'broken' links.
<br/>
I'm working on a two-pronged approach: reduce that number to something more respectable and provide a simple method for the user to fix a broken link.
            <br/>
            Here's what a broken link looks like:
            <img align="center" src="images/broken_links.png"/>

</p>
          In the third link above, you can see two more problems:
<ul>
            <li>The text has been marked up in such a way that the link extends over more than one word.
              This is is a the cross-reference is marked up in Perseus:<br/>
              <span style="margin:20px;background-color:#eeeeee">
                &lt;orth type="arrow" lang="ar"&gt;A_iy~aAka waAlt~aA^a*~iY&lt;/orth&gt;
</span>
              It would be relatively simple to convert all these multi-word links to single word links during the database build, something the user would never see. (The Perseus text uses the Buckwalter transliteration of Arabic.)

</li>
            <li>When the link text is followed immediately by more Arabic, the down arrow is shown out of place.</li>
          </ul>
